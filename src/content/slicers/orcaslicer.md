# OrcaSlicer

OrcaSlicer is the newest addition to the 3D printing slicer ecosystem, built for advanced users who demand maximum control and cutting-edge features. Based on PrusaSlicer but with rapid independent development, it pushes the boundaries of what's possible in 3D printing.

## Advanced Features

- **Hybrid Infill**: Combine multiple infill patterns in a single print
- **Smart Fill**: Intelligent material usage optimization
- **Advanced Calibration**: Comprehensive printer tuning tools
- **Custom G-code Macros**: Powerful scripting capabilities
- **Experimental Features**: Latest research implementations

## Why OrcaSlicer Stands Out

- **Rapid Development**: Features that won't be in other slicers for months
- **Community Driven**: Direct feedback loop with active users
- **No Corporate Limitations**: Pure focus on features and performance
- **Bleeding Edge**: First to implement new slicing techniques
- **Power User Focus**: Built by and for advanced users

## Cutting-Edge Capabilities

- **Adaptive Cubic Infill**: Revolutionary infill that adapts to stress
- **Arc Welder Integration**: Smooth curves with G2/G3 commands
- **Advanced Bridging**: Superior overhang performance
- **Multi-material Optimization**: Waste reduction for MMU prints
- **Custom Support Enforcers**: Precise support control

## Perfect For

- **Advanced Hobbyists**: Users who love tweaking and optimizing
- **Professional Prototyping**: Demanding commercial applications
