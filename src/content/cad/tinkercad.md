## TinkerCad

**TinkerCad** is a free, web-based 3D design platform developed by Autodesk that serves as the perfect introduction to 3D modeling and design. Designed with beginners in mind, TinkerCad offers an intuitive drag-and-drop interface that makes 3D design accessible to users of all ages and skill levels.

The platform features a comprehensive library of basic shapes and tools that can be combined, modified, and manipulated to create complex 3D models. Users can easily resize, rotate, group, and align objects using simple controls, while advanced features like the ruler tool, workplane manipulation, and shape generators provide additional design flexibility.

TinkerCad excels as an educational tool, offering built-in tutorials, lesson plans aligned with academic standards, and classroom management features. The platform seamlessly integrates with 3D printing workflows, allowing users to export designs in STL format for immediate fabrication. Beyond 3D modeling, TinkerCad also includes electronics simulation and coding capabilities through Codeblocks, making it a versatile STEM learning platform that bridges digital design with physical making.
