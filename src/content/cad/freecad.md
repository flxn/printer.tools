## FreeCAD

**FreeCAD** is a powerful, open-source parametric 3D modeling software designed for creating real-world objects of any size. Built on the robust Open CASCADE Technology geometry kernel, it excels at precision modeling with full parametric capabilities, allowing users to easily modify designs by adjusting parameters in the model history.

Perfect for **3D printing enthusiasts**, FreeCAD offers comprehensive tools for designing printable objects, from simple prototypes to complex mechanical parts. Its constraint-based 2D sketcher serves as the foundation for creating 3D models, while specialized workbenches handle everything from basic part design to advanced assembly modeling.

The software supports extensive file format compatibility, including **STL, OBJ, STEP, IGES**, and many others essential for 3D printing workflows. FreeCAD's multiplatform availability (Windows, Mac, Linux) and Python scripting capabilities make it highly customizable for specific needs.

With dedicated workbenches for mechanical engineering, architecture, and manufacturing, plus a thriving community providing add-ons and extensive documentation, FreeCAD delivers professional-grade CAD capabilities without licensing fees or vendor lock-inâ€”making it an ideal choice for makers, educators, and professionals alike.
