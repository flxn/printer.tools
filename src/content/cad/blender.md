## Blender

**Blender** is a free and open-source 3D creation suite that provides comprehensive tools for the entire 3D pipeline, including modeling, sculpting, animation, rendering, and compositing. Licensed under GNU GPL, Blender offers professional-grade capabilities without cost, making it accessible to individuals and studios of all sizes.

For 3D printing workflows, Blender excels with its robust modeling tools, including modifiers for non-destructive editing, advanced sculpting brushes, and precise UV unwrapping capabilities. The built-in **3D Print Toolbox** addon specifically addresses 3D printing needs by analyzing mesh integrity, checking for non-manifold edges, intersections, and other issues that could cause printing problems. It ensures models are "watertight" and print-ready.

Blender's **Cycles render engine** provides photorealistic visualization of designs, while **Geometry Nodes** enables procedural modeling workflows. The software supports all major file formats and runs cross-platform on Windows, macOS, and Linux. With an active community contributing extensions and tutorials, Blender continues evolving as a powerful, cost-effective solution for 3D printing preparation and design.
