# AutoCAD

AutoCAD is Autodesk's flagship drafting and design software with a legacy spanning over 40 years in the industry. While traditionally focused on 2D technical drawing, modern AutoCAD offers powerful 3D capabilities that make it relevant for various aspects of 3D printing preparation and documentation.

## Core Design Capabilities

### Professional Drafting Tools
- **Precision Drawing**: Industry-standard 2D drafting tools
- **Annotation System**: Comprehensive dimensioning and notes
- **Layer Management**: Organize complex drawings efficiently
- **Block System**: Create and reuse design elements
- **Standards Compliance**: Support for various drafting standards

### Extended Design Features
- **3D Modeling**: Solid, surface, and mesh modeling capabilities
- **Specialized Toolsets**: Industry-specific functionality
- **Parametric Drawing**: Constraint-based design tools
- **Dynamic Blocks**: Create flexible, reusable components
- **External References**: Link and coordinate multiple drawings

## Why AutoCAD Matters for 3D Printing

### Technical Documentation
- **Detailed Specifications**: Create precise documentation for prints
- **Multiple Views**: Generate orthographic and sectional views
- **Dimension Control**: Ensure accurate measurements for printing
- **Assembly Documentation**: Document how printed parts fit together
- **Technical Instructions**: Create guides for post-processing

### 3D Capabilities
- **STL Export**: Generate files for 3D printing
- **3D Navigation**: Visualize models from all angles
