## SOLIDWORKS

**SOLIDWORKS** is the industry-standard 3D CAD software trusted by over 7 million design and engineering professionals worldwide. Developed by Dassault Syst√®mes, this powerful yet intuitive platform streamlines the entire product development process from initial concept to manufacturing.

### Key Features for 3D Printing

SOLIDWORKS excels in 3D printing applications with its integrated **Print3D** feature, allowing direct printing to 3D printers with built-in orientation tools, scaling options, and print volume visualization. The software supports multiple export formats including STL, 3MF, and AMF files essential for 3D printing workflows.

Advanced evaluation tools help optimize designs for additive manufacturing, including thickness analysis to prevent wall failures, geometry validation for surface bodies, and interference detection for assemblies. The software's section view capabilities simulate slicing processes, while clearance verification ensures proper fit for multi-part prints.

### Professional Design Capabilities

With parametric modeling, associative drawings, and robust assembly management, SOLIDWORKS handles everything from simple prototypes to complex multi-component designs. Its cloud-based collaboration tools enable real-time design sharing and markup, making it ideal for teams working on 3D printing projects across different locations.
