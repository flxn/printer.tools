# STL Gears

STL Gears is the ultimate tool for generating custom 3D printable gears with precise mechanical specifications. Whether you're fixing a broken appliance, building a robot, or learning about mechanical engineering, this tool provides professional-grade gear generation.

## Gear Types Supported

- **Spur Gears**: Standard straight-toothed gears
- **Helical Gears**: Angled teeth for smoother operation
- **Bevel Gears**: For 90-degree angle transmissions
- **Worm Gears**: High reduction ratio systems
- **Planetary Gears**: Complex gear train systems
- **Rack and Pinion**: Linear motion conversion

## Key Features

- **Parametric Design**: Full control over all gear specifications
- **Engineering Accuracy**: Precise tooth profiles and dimensions
- **Multiple Standards**: Support for various gear standards
- **STL Export**: Ready-to-print files with optimal orientation
- **Tolerance Compensation**: Adjusted for 3D printing limitations

## Professional Applications

- **Machine Repair**: Replace broken gears in appliances
- **Robotics**: Custom gear ratios for robotic systems
- **Prototyping**: Test mechanical concepts quickly
- **Education**: Learn gear theory through hands-on creation
- **Custom Mechanisms**: Build unique mechanical solutions

## Advanced Parameters

- **Module/Pitch**: Control tooth size and spacing
- **Pressure Angle**: Optimize for strength or smoothness
- **Backlash**: Adjust for printing tolerances
- **Hub Design**: Custom bore sizes and keyways
- **Material Compensation**: Account for different filament properties

## Getting Started

1. Visit STL Gears
2. Select your gear type and specifications
3. Input desired parameters (teeth, module, bore size)
4. Preview the gear mesh and operation
5. Download optimized STL files
6. Print with appropriate settings for mechanical parts

## Printing Recommendations

- **Material**: PETG or ABS for durability
- **Layer Height**: 0.2mm for smooth operation
- **Infill**: 50%+ for strength
- **Orientation**: Flat on bed for best tooth accuracy
- **Post-processing**: Light sanding for smooth operation

Perfect for engineers, makers, educators, and anyone who needs custom mechanical components.
