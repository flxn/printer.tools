# PrusaSlicer

PrusaSlicer is an advanced, feature-rich slicing software originally based on Slic3r but extensively enhanced by Prusa Research. While optimized for Prusa printers, it works excellently with many other 3D printers.

## What Makes PrusaSlicer Special

- **Advanced Features**: Cutting-edge slicing algorithms and features
- **Paint-on Supports**: Intuitive support placement with brush tools
- **Variable Layer Heights**: Smooth transitions for optimal quality
- **Multi-Material Wizard**: Simplified multi-color printing setup
- **Print Analytics**: Detailed statistics and print optimization

## Key Features

### Smart Slicing
- **Adaptive Layer Heights**: Automatic optimization based on model geometry
- **Ironing**: Smooth top surfaces with heated nozzle passes
- **Organic Supports**: Tree-like supports that use less material
- **Avoid Crossing Perimeters**: Minimize visible travel marks

### Visual Tools
- **Paint-on Supports**: Brush on supports exactly where needed
- **Seam Painting**: Control where layer seams appear
- **Infill Painting**: Variable infill density within single objects
- **Multi-Material Painting**: Assign colors to specific regions

### Advanced Print Control
