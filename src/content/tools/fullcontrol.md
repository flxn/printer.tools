## FullControl - Unconstrained 3D Printing Design

**FullControl** is a revolutionary Python-based toolpath design system that breaks free from conventional 3D printing workflows. Instead of the traditional CAD → STL → slice approach, FullControl allows direct design of print paths, giving users complete control over every aspect of the printing process.

The platform enables explicit control of printer state changes including position, speed, temperature, and extrusion settings. Users can create custom toolpaths that would be impossible with standard slicing software, opening new possibilities for complex geometries, multi-axis printing, and experimental printing techniques.

**Key Features:**
- Direct G-code generation from Python scripts
- Interactive Jupyter notebook tutorials and templates
- Web-based parametric design interface at fullcontrol.xyz
- Support for multi-axis printing capabilities
- Extensive documentation and community resources

Perfect for researchers, advanced makers, and anyone seeking to push the boundaries of additive manufacturing beyond traditional layer-based approaches.
