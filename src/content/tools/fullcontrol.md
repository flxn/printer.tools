# FullControl Design Library

FullControl is a revolutionary tool that enables the generation of GCode for non-planar 3D printing. This advanced platform opens up new possibilities for creating complex geometries that traditional layer-based printing cannot achieve.

## Key Features

- **Non-planar Printing**: Generate GCode for curved and complex surface printing
- **Browser-based**: No installation required, works directly in your web browser
- **Research-grade**: Developed for advanced manufacturing and research applications
- **Custom GCode**: Full control over toolpath generation
- **Experimental**: Cutting-edge features for pushing 3D printing boundaries

## Revolutionary Approach

Traditional 3D printing builds objects layer by layer in flat planes. FullControl breaks this limitation by allowing toolpaths that follow curved surfaces, enabling stronger parts, better surface finishes, and previously impossible geometries.

## Use Cases

- **Research Projects**: Explore new manufacturing possibilities
- **Complex Geometries**: Print shapes impossible with traditional slicing
- **Stronger Parts**: Follow stress lines for improved mechanical properties
- **Surface Quality**: Achieve smooth curved surfaces without layer lines

## Getting Started

1. Visit the FullControl website
2. Explore the documentation and examples
3. Design your non-planar toolpath
4. Export custom GCode
5. Test on a compatible 3D printer

Note: Requires understanding of GCode and advanced 3D printing concepts.
