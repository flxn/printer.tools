## Gridfinity.xyz - Modular 3D Printing Storage System

**Gridfinity.xyz** serves as the unofficial wiki and community hub for Gridfinity, an innovative open-source modular storage system designed specifically for workshops and maker spaces. Built on a standardized grid of 42x42x7mm units, Gridfinity offers a completely customizable organization solution that's almost entirely 3D printable.

The platform provides access to powerful online generators from Perplexing Labs and gridfinitygenerator.com, allowing users to create custom bins, baseplates, and lids by simply inputting their desired dimensions. Originally inspired by Alexander Chappels' Assortment System and developed by Zack Freedman, Gridfinity has evolved into a thriving community-driven project released under the MIT license.

The website features comprehensive FAQs covering printing optimization tips (including larger nozzle recommendations), assembly guidance for magnets and labels, and sourcing information for non-printable components. With its modular design philosophy and active Discord community, Gridfinity represents the ultimate free solution for workshop organization and productivity enhancement.
