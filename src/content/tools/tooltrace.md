## Tooltrace — One-Click Tool Inserts from a Photo

Tooltrace is an AI-powered online designer that converts a top‑down photo of your tools into a ready‑to‑cut layout for shadowbox/Kaizen foam or into a custom Gridfinity insert. After the outlines are generated, you can tweak placement, spacing, and foam dimensions before exporting.

### Highlights
- Snap a photo → get foam or Gridfinity cutouts automatically
- Edit outlines and layout right in the browser
- Export for CNC/laser workflows (e.g., DXF/SVG)
- Option to order professionally cut foam

### Best Results Tips
- Use an evenly lit, top‑down photo
- Place tools on a plain, high‑contrast background
- Keep items separated so the outlines are distinct
