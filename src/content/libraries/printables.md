## Printables.com

**Printables.com** is a comprehensive 3D model repository and community platform created by Prusa Research, originally launched as PrusaPrinters.org in 2019. The platform serves as a curated database of high-quality, free 3D printable models accessible to all makers regardless of their printer brand.

Unlike other repositories with duplicate content, Printables emphasizes quality curation and unique designs. The platform features an active community with monthly design contests, rewarding participants with prizes including Prusa printers and filament. Users earn "Prusameters" points for uploading models, sharing photos of finished prints ("Makes"), and community engagement, which can be exchanged for free Prusament filament and merchandise.

Key features include advanced search filters, built-in 3D model viewer supporting STL, 3MF, and G-code files, user collections, and comprehensive community groups organized by printer brands, regions, and interests. The ad-free platform continuously develops new features with dedicated support from Prusa Research, making it a premier destination for 3D printing enthusiasts seeking quality models and community engagement.
